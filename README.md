# Guess the Number Game - Python
A classic and simple command-line game where the player tries to guess a secret number chosen by the computer.


## Description
This is a basic, interactive game built entirely in Python. The program generates a random integer between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback, telling the player whether their guess was too high or too low. The game ends when the player either guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.


## Features
Interactive Gameplay: Engages the user by asking for their name and providing direct feedback.

Random Number Generation: Ensures a different secret number every time the game is played.

Limited Guesses: Adds a layer of challenge by giving the player a fixed number of attempts (10).

Input Validation: Checks if the player's input is a valid number.

Clear Feedback: Informs the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
